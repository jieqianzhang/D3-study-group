# Basical HTML 

## Vocabulary words for HTML
Developer Tools / Web Inspector / Dev Tools
HTML tags
DOM
Attribute

### Developer Tools / Web Inspector / Dev Tools
By using web inspector in browsers, you can inspect the “DOM” or Document Object Model. It’s displaying the underlying ``LIVE REALTIME`` HTML code for the web page, which is different than the static HTML document you’ve written.

### HTML tags
Opening Tag ``<p>``
Closing Tag ``</p>``

### Attributes
Attributes are pieces of information that can go into tags.
For example: 
```<a href="https://www.wsj.com"></a>```
href="" go inside the <a> tag to specify where a user will go when they click a link.
  
Attributes to use for CSS:
There are three attributes that can go in HTML tags: 
id attibute — This is a unique term that gives this tag an identifier we can reference in our CSS.
class attribute — This is a grouping term that allows us to reference multiple tags in our CSS.
style attribute — This is a special way to include inline CSS, basically putting CSS code directly into an HTML tag.

#### Data Attribute

The data attribute will be important later when we do JavaScript. This attribute allows us to include some arbitrary data to HTML tags, which can be used by plugins or many other JavaScript utilities.

Data attributes always start with the word data and then end with a hyphen. The words that come after that depend on the plugin being used. There might be a plugin that wants the word “slideshow” as a data attribute. In your html tag, you might include: data-slideshow="true" The data keyword here is slideshow, and the value you assign it is true.
